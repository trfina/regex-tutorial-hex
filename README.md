# <b>Regex Tutorial:  Matching a Hex Value</b>

<p>Regular expressions (Regex) are used by Data Scientists and other IT professionals to extract and process data into data sets that meet certain criteria.</p>
<p>Web scraping, search and replace, and pattern matching are but a few of the many tasks that can be accomplished with Regex.</p>

## <b>Summary</b>

<p>This tutorial describes how to match a <b>hex color code value</b> using Regex:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9|{3})$/</p>

<p>Hexidecimal Color Values (Hex Codes) are primarily used in style sheets to represent color values for a computer screen.  A hex color code begins with `#`, followed by three sets of two-digit numbers, i.e. (#01ff04). Each set of hexidecimal numbers represents the colors red, green and blue, respectivly.  A hex color can also be represented by 3 characters (shorthand or hex-triplet), if each set of the two-digits numbers use the same character.</p>

 <ul For Example:>
 <li>#000000 represents no red, no green and no blue, which equates to black in the color spectrum.</li>
 <li>#FFFFFF represents max red, max green and max blue, which equates to white in the color spectrum.</li>
 <li>#000 is the shorthand/hex-triplet representation of black.</li>
 <li>#FFF is the shorthand/hex-triplet representation of white.</li>
 <li>#0d98ba is a medium shade of dark cyan</li>
 </ul>

# Regex Components

## Matching a Hex Value â€“ `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

## Anchors 
### Metacharacters ^ and $

<p>Anchors define where the search parameters begin and end while parsing through a string of data.

<ul>
<li>In the hex color value regex <b>^</b>#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})<b>$</b>:

`^` indicates to start a search for the `#` character.  A search for the string `([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})` is initiated as defined by ending anchor `$`.
</li>
<li>`^abc` will search for string or line that begins with `abc`</li>
<li>`abc$` will search for a string or line that ends with `abc`</li>
</ul>
</p>

## Quantifiers
### Metacharacters  * + ? and {}

<p>Quantifiers match a number of instances of a character, group, or character class in a string.
<ol>
<li>`*` - match 0 or more of previous expression</li>
<li>`+` - match 1 or more of previous expression</li>
<li>`?` - match 0 or 1 of previous expression</li>
<li>`{n}` - explicit number or a range of matches</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`
The hex color regex above uses  `?`, `{6}` and `{3}` to quantify the string.</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>`?` matches the `#` character preceding a hex color code for 0 or 1 of previous string expressions.  This means that all hex codes are considered a match whether it has a `#` preceding the color code or not.  </p>
<p>All color codes used in style sheets have the `#` preceeding the color code, right?  Why would it be excluded?  One explanation is that the `#` symbol is excluded from a hex color code in databases when large data sets are converted from one color schema to another in order to save storage space.</p></li>
<li>
`{6}` quantifies that up to six characters in the explicit set [a-z0-9] can be matched.  `{3}` quantifies up to three characters of [a-z0-9] to be matched.</li>
</ol>
Other examples:
<ol>
<li>`xyz*` matches a string that has `xy` followed by 0 or more `z` characters</li>
<li>`xyz+` matches a string that has `xy` followed by 1 or more `z` characters</li>
<li>`xyz{3}` expects the string  `xy` followed by 3 `z` characters</li>
<li>`xyz{2,10}` matches a string that has `xy` followed by 2 up to 10 `z` characters</li>
</ol>
